# Planner Component

A simple but flexible table react component to display JSON data.
As simple as feeding it with an array of objects.

##Usage
```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    Components
    redux
    selctors
    source
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `yarn start`
 
`yarn test`

`yarn run build`

##What's next?
Tests, tests, tests... I need to add tests for the different settings in order to continue the developing of new features.

Of course, issues reports, feature and pull requests are welcome. If Planner can make you not to code a react table again I will be happy to help.
